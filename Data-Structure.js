"question": "Which of the following usees FIFO method",
  "option1": "Queue",
  "option2": "Stack",
  "option3": "Hash Table",
  "option4": "Binary Search Tree",
  "reason" : "Queue maintains two pointers − front and rear. In queue data structure, the item inserted first will always be removed first, hence FIFO!",
  "answer":  "1"
},{
"question": " A circular linked list can be used for",
  "option1": "Stack",
  "option2": "Queue",
  "option3": "Both stack and Queue",
  "option4": "Neither Stack and Queue",
  "reason" : "Both stack and queue data structure can be represented by circular linked-list.",
  "answer":  "3"
},{

"question": "Which of the following searching techniques do not require the data to be in sorted form",
  "option1": "Binary Search",
  "option2": "Interpolation Search",
  "option3": "Linear Search",
  "option4": "All of the Above",
  "reason" : "Both binary and interpolation search requires data set to be in sorted form. Linear search can work even if the data is not sorted.",
  "answer":  "1"
},{
"question": "Time required to merge two sorted lists of size m and n, is",
  "option1": "O(m|n)",
  "option2": "O(m+n)",
  "option3": "O(m log n)",
  "option4": "O(n log m)",
  "reason" : "The time required to merge two sorted list is Ο(m + n).",
  "answer":  "2"
},{
"question": " In a min heap",
  "option1": "Minimum values are Stored",
  "option2": "Child nodes are less value than parent nodes",
  "option3": "Parent nodes have less value than child nodes",
  "option4": "Maximum value is contained by the root node",
  "reason" : "In a min heap, parent nodes store lesser values than child nodes. The minimum value of the entire heap is stored at root.",
  "answer":  "3"
},{
"question": " A balance factor in AVL tree is used to check",
  "option1": "What rotation to make",
  "option2": "If all child nodes are at the same level",
  "option3": "When the last rotation occured",
  "option4": "if tree is inbalanced",
  "reason" : "The balance factor (BalanceFactor = height(left-sutree) − height(right-sutree)) is used to check if the tree is balanced or unbalanced.",
  "answer":  "4"
},{
"question": " Aposterior analysis are more accurate than apriori analysis because −",
  "option1": "it contains the real data",
  "option2": "It assumes all other factors to be dynamic",
  "option3": "It assumes all other factors to be constant",
  "option4": "it is a result of reverse -engineering",
  "reason" : "In this analysis, actual statistics like running time and space required, are collected.",
  "answer":  "2"
},{
  "question": " A connected (all vertices have atleast one neighbour ,undirected grpah of N vertices has N-1 edges.Number of spanning tree that can be constructed)",
  "option1": "it contains the real data",
  "option2": "N *(N-1)",
  "option3": "N-1",
  "option4": "N",
